TalkShow

shows pictures from the internet
of the things you talk about

instant image search 
using continous narrative speech transcription
and named entity recognition


User's Guide

1. Speak slowly and clearly
2. Pause between names

The program doesn't have any commands.  It constantly analyzes your speech,
looking for proper names.  

Start by saying some famous names:  TV shows, bands, cities, monuments, 
celebrities, historical figures, brands, products.  Anything with an image that
might be found on the internet.

If it doesn't recognize a name, try using the name in a complete sentence.

Try telling a story that mentions some well-known people, places, or things.  
Remember to pause each time you mention a name.
Talk about your last vacation or the time you met a celebrity.

Turn it on a let it eavesdrop while you have a conversation.


What it does

TalkShow transcribes your speech, mines the text for proper names, 
does an internet image search, and displays search results as a slideshow.  

When you pause for a second, the transcribed words since the last pause are examined.  
If there are capitalized words in this chunk, a search for 20 hits is initiated 
for each name.  If there are none, the  entire phrase is searched for only three hits.

Between pauses, the program repeatedly checks the words that have arrived since the last 
pause, looking for new names. If it finds one, it interrups to the slideshow to 
display the new image as soon as possible.

The slideshow cycles through the results for all queries, looking for images 
that have not been displayed yet, paying attention to the rank of an image in 
the search results list.  Top hits for each query are displayed first.


How it works

Named Entity Recognition:

Homegrown, on the cheap.  For this version, we use phrase shape to isolate sequences of 
capitalized words that may be names.  This works only in English at the moment.
For other languages, the program searches for all the words you speak.  It does 
a new search whenever you pause.
